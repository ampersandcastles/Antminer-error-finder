# Antminer error finder

Checks for specific strings in log files of Antminer machines. Currently works with stock firmware (and barely at that). Expand to Braiins & LuxOS. This now outputs a csv file to a folder structure of `year/month/day/`.

Started using pandas for writing the csv and for grouping of errors based on machine.
